# kanban-rust

kanban-rust is a basic implementation of a Kanban board in Rust. It is currently WIP.

The board has 3 columns representing task status: Todo, In Progress, Done.

Move around the board using hjkl (basic vim movements).

Create a new task using 'n'. Enter the name of the task and press enter to add it to the board.

# Installation

Make sure to have Rust language installed.

Clone the repository, then call
```
cargo run
```

You can now move around and see the board.
